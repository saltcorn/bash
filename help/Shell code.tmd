The `run_bash_script` action allows you to run shell code. It used to be 
restricted to bash scripts, but you can now use any shell interpreter 
(including Python).

If you want to use a different shell interpreter than `bash`, you can set 
the first line to a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))
